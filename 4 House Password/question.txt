Help Nikola develop a password security check module for Sofia. The password will be considered strong enough if
 its length is greater than or equal to 10 symbols, it has at least one number, as well as containing one uppercase
  letter and one lowercase letter in it.

Input data: A string that is a password (Unicode for python 2.7).

Output data: The output will be true if the password is safe.

Example:
checkio('A1213pokl')==False
checkio('bAse730onE')==True
checkio('asasasasasasasaas')==False
checkio('QWERTYqwerty')==False
checkio('123456123456')==False
checkio('QwErTy911poqqqq')==True
How it is used: If you are worried about security of your app or service, then you can check users' passwords for complexity.
