You are given a chunk of text which contains different English letters and punctuation symbols. You should to find the
most frequent letter in the text. The letter must be in lower case.
Case does not matter and "A" == "a". Don't count punctuation symbols and whitespaces, only letters. If you have two or
 more letters with the same frequency, then return the first in the alphabet. (Ex: we have "b" and "f" as the most
 frequent, then return "b")

Input: A text for analysis. A string (Unicode).

Output: The most frequent letter. A string.

Example:
checkio("Hello World!") == "l"
checkio("How do you do?") == "o"
checkio("One") == "e"

How it is used: For most of decryption tasks need to know the frequency of occurrence of various letters in the texts.
Also this information may be interesting for language experts. As example we can easily crack simple addition or
substitution cipher if we know the frequency of appearing the letters.
