A median is a number in a list that is in between the highest numbers and the lowest numbers. If there is an even number
 of numbers, then there is no single middle value: the median is then defined as the mean or average of the two middle
 values. For this mission, you are given a list of integers. With it, you must separate the upper half of the numbers,
  from the lower half and find the median.

Input: A list of integers.

Output: A float.

Example:
1
2
3
4
checkio([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 3
checkio([3, 1, 2, 5, 3]) == 3
checkio([1, 300, 2, 200, 1]) == 2
checkio([3, 6, 20, 99, 10, 15]) == 12.5
How it is used: The median has usage for Statistics and Probability theory. It very significant value for skewed
 distribution. For example, we want to know average wealth of people and gained some data -- 100 people have 100$ in
  month and 10 people have 1000000$. If we use average, then we have 91000$ at man. This is weird value and don't show
   to us the real picture. So for this case the median will give to us more useful value.
